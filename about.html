            <h2>About Nivedita Anandmayee</h2>
            <p>
                Nivedita Anandmayee, based in Shri Vrindavan Dham, is a spiritual leader, mentor, author, thought leader, international spiritual speaker, and a coach in leadership, growth, and well-being. She has conducted discourses across the world and delivered talks and workshops at prestigious institutions such as IIT Delhi and Medanta, as well as various universities and colleges. Nivedita is an alumna of IIM Calcutta.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has been recognized by the Government of Haryana as one of the 20 exemplary women across the country. Nivedita is the author of several books including “Develop Power of Healing” (released by Dr. Trehan and the Governor of Haryana), “Anand ki Anubhuti,” and “Master the Wheel of Karma” (released by Pujya Gita Manish Swami Gyanand and eminent saints of India). Her upcoming book, “Geeta Atmasadh,” focuses on incorporating the profound concepts of the Bhagavad Gita into daily life through simple, practical activities.

            <p>
                Observing the youth drifting away from their potential and a world filled with anxiety and depression despite external success, she made it her mission to create a blissful world where individuals are content, joyful, and aligned with their life’s purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                In her early career, Nivedita worked with reputed consulting and IT firms, leading and driving paradigm shifts. However, she realized there was something incomplete and that her true purpose on earth was different, something she had always aspired to pursue since childhood.
